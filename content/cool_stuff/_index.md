### Climate Workshop

I’m an animator for the [2 Tons workshop](https://en.2tonnes.org/), which is a fun way to learn about our carbon footprint and how we can, both individually and collectively, shift our lifestyles to reach 2 tons of CO2 per person per year by 2050.
I also enjoy (and recommend) the [different Fresk workshops](https://wiki.climatefresk.org/?title=Les_fresques_amies), with the most well-known being the [Climate Fresk](https://climatefresk.org/world/). I’ve also participated in the Planetary Frontier's, *Numérique*'s (digital), and Biodiversity's Fresks, which are also excellent (though currently available only in French).

### Climate Games

Here are a few fun games that help educate about climate urgency:
