### Fresk (or Collage) Workshops

I enjoy (and recommend) the [different Fresk workshops](https://wiki.climatefresk.org/?title=Les_fresques_amies), the most well-known being the [Climate Fresk](https://climatefresk.org/world/). I’ve also participated in the Planetary Frontiers, *Numérique* (Digital), Nutrition, and Biodiversity Fresks, which are also excellent (though currently available only in French). The Fresk movement also raises awareness about social inequalities. I especially like the Diversity Fresk, which challenges your knowledge about the impacts and issues of diversity in our societies and how we can address them.

As I believe that social dynamics are an important lever to tackle social inequalities and ecological urgency, I decided to actively participate in this movement by becoming an animator myself. At present, I have learned and feel comfortable animating:

- The [2 Tons workshop](https://en.2tonnes.org/), which is a fun way to learn about our carbon footprint and how we can, both individually and collectively, shift our lifestyles to reach 2 tons of CO₂ per person per year by 2050.
- The [Biodiversity Collage](https://www.fresquedelabiodiversite.org/), designed to "understand the challenges and pressures around biodiversity, through a fun, collaborative, visual, and accessible workshop based on the IPBES report."
- The [Low-Tech Fresk](https://fresquedeslowtechs.org/), which teaches about the sustainability of technologies.

If you would like to participate in one of this workshop, please reach out !

### Awareness Games

Here are a few fun games that help educate about climate urgency:

- [Green New Deal Simulator](https://molleindustria.itch.io/green-new-deal-simulator)
- [Beecarbonize](https://charlesgames.itch.io/beecarbonize)
