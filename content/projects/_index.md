### Master Thesis

During my Master thesis in the [Neuro-iX](https://neuro-ix.github.io/) lab at École de Technologie Supérieure, I developed a few tools :

- [**Agitation**](https://github.com/Neuro-iX/agitation) : The outcome of my thesis : a deep learning based tool to quantify motion in T1w brain MRI. We provide a simple CLI for dataset and subject level inference, integration with [Boutiques](https://boutiques.github.io/) and [Nipoppy](https://nipoppy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and a standalone [container](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/chbricout/agitation/general). 
- [**MotionScore**](https://github.com/Neuro-iX/MotionScore) : A simple web tool to score volume based on the amount of motion artifact and the type of expression.


### Current Personal Projects (More on [GitHub](https://github.com/chbricout))

- [Lighterre](https://tributerre.neocities.org/): A lightweight website for the sustainable development committee *Tributerre*. We’re building a list of vegetarian recipes, so feel free to send any you like to my email!

- [Hugo Sizer](https://github.com/chbricout/hugo-sizer): A Python CLI tool to compute and insert full page weight (including media, scripts, stylesheets, etc.) for static Hugo websites. I developed this for my personal website and the *Lighterre* project.
