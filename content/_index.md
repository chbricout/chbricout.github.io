### About Me

I'm currently a master's student in Computer Science at *École de Technologie Supérieure (ETS)* and Mila in Montréal, working in the [Neuro-iX lab](https://neuro-ix.github.io/). At the same time, I'm also completing a *Diplôme d'Ingénieur* (equivalent to a combined BS/MS) at *Université de Technologie de Compiègne* / Sorbonne Alliance in France, with a specialization in AI and Data Science. I will be starting a PhD in October supervised by Antonio Vergari at University of Edinburgh on the topic of sustainable probabilistic machine learning.

My research, under the supervision of Sylvain Bouix and Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, focuses on automating brain MRI quality control using deep learning. Specifically, I'm working on detecting and quantifying motion artifacts in 3D T1-weighted brain MRIs. It's a tricky challenge due to limited data and the high memory demand of training convolutional neural networks on 3D volumes.

### Research Interests

Beyond the medical space, I'm also passionate about Open Science and making AI more sustainable. Right now, deep learning is often data-inefficient, power-hungry, and behaves like a black box. Plus, designing or scaling models is painfully hard with loads of hyperparameters to try. I think there’s huge potential in improving our methods and exploring alternative approaches like Gaussian Processes or Neurosymbolic AI. These are the topics I’d love to dive into during a PhD.

### Involvement

Outside the lab, I stay pretty active in the community. I'm part of ETS’s music club where I sing and play bass in two bands—one pop/jazz and one indie rock. I also lead the project to create a sustainable, zero-waste student coffee shop at ETS (opening in May 2025 !).

As a project manager in ETS's sustainable committee, [Tributerre](https://tributerre.neocities.org/), I redesigned our old, resource-heavy Wix website with a lightweight, eco-friendly version that’s currently hosted on Neocities. We’re planning to host it on a Raspberry Pi Zero powered by an unused solar panel from one of the labs at ETS. As a member of the student association, I’ve also been pushing for the use of sewable patches instead of T-shirts for clubs and associations to help reduce waste.

I am also an animator for two workshops:
- The [2 Tons workshop](https://en.2tonnes.org/), a fun game that teaches how to reduce personal and global carbon footprints to 2 tons of CO2eq by 2050 through individual and collective decisions.
- The [Low-Tech Fresk](https://fresquedeslowtechs.org/) (French only), which demonstrates how the Low-Tech approach addresses the pressing problems of our current system.
